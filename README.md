# Tangents of Primes
This repo contians code used to find primes which have a tangent larger than themselves.  This was inspired by [Matt Parker's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7eJb8n8zAw&t=0s) video this week. To run the code, make sure you have the Primes Julia package installed and then simpy run `julia continued_fractions_direct.jl`.
